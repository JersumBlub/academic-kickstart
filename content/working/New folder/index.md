abstract: "Proponents of school choice argue that deregulating public education would allow for new firms to enter the market, generating competitive pressure on existing schools to increase educational quality. Although there exists a large school choice literature evaluating whether competitive pressure, created by more schooling options, leads to achievement gains, little attention has been paid to the direct effect of introducing new schools to the marketplace on student outcomes. Most of the studies that explore the relationship between newly built or renovated schools and test scores examine the effects of increased capital expenditures in absence of competitive pressure (Hashim, Strunk, and Marsh, 2018; Conlin and Thompson, 2017; Martorell, Stange, and McFarlin, 2016; Neilson and Zimmerman 2014; Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein, 2010). This work finds some small, positive effects of attending newly built schools after their first year of operation. 

 

This study links these two literatures by providing some of the first evidence concerning the effects of school openings in a deregulated market. Specifically, we study school openings in Michigan where students can participate in interdistrict, intradistrict, and charter school choice. Furthermore, no caps exist for the number of charter schools or the number of students who can attend a school outside of their resident district, and universities and colleges can authorize charter schools anywhere in the state. In fact, there have been over 500 school openings in the past decade, a third of which have been charter schools. Thus, this setting provides the ideal situation to evaluate whether market induced changes in the supply of schools increase achievement.  

 

Using a rich panel of student level enrollment and achievement data for all public school students in Michigan from 2009 to 2018, we estimate the effect of attending a newly opened school on student achievement and attendance. To accomplish this, we employ an event study approach where we compare the outcomes before and after switching schools of students who have attend a newly opened school to other students who changed to existing schools before and after switching schools. We also use students who will attend newly opened schools in a future year as an alternative comparison group using an approach similar to Deshpande and Li (2018). Additionally, we test whether these effects differ for charter school openings as well as in education markets that are adding more schools instead of replacing existing schools to determine whether market induced openings have a differential effect on achievement.  

 

In accordance with prior literature concerning newly built schools, our preliminary results suggest that students who attend newly opened schools experience a decrease in achievement in the first year the school is open with increases in test scores in future years. These results may imply that new schools, whether or not they are located in new buildings, may need extra support in the first year from their district or management organization in order to offset the initial negative effects of school openings.
