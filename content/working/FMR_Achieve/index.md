abstract: "This paper estimates the impact of race matched \textcolor{MSUgreen}{faculty (i.e.\ from a student's perspective, a teacher that does not share a classroom with said student)} on a student's math test score. Using administrative panel data between school years 2008-09 through 2017-18 from Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), we estimate that \textcolor{MSUgreen}{Latinx and White students see positive impacts of race matched faculty}. By basing our study in LAUSD, which has a large proportion of Latinx students and teachers, we are able to fill a gap within the literature by examining the effects of race match and faculty race match on Latinx students. Our findings indicate that \textcolor{MSUgreen}{matching Latinx students to racially congruent teachers and faculty improve math test scores by 0.005 standard deviations}. Increasing the supply of Latinx teachers may provide as a crucial catalyst in decreasing the achievement gaps found between Latinx and White students."
